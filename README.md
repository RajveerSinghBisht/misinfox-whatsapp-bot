To draw more attention and make it more scannable, you can combine this into a single, emphasized paragraph or list item.

Example:
**Important: Set up your environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys. You will need a Google API Key and Custom Search CX for searching, and a Gemini API Key for the AI-powered verdicts.
`GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>`
`GOOGLE_CX=<your_google_custom_search_cx>`
`GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>`" type="suggestion">

```

flask run

```

## üì± Twilio Setup

To connect the bot to WhatsApp, you'll need a **Twilio account** and to activate the **WhatsApp sandbox**. Configure your Twilio webhook URL to point to your deployed function or local tunnel (e.g., using `ngrok`). Once set up, send a message to your sandbox number to test the bot.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

<comment-tag id="5">1. A user sends a WhatsApp message to the bot.

2. The bot's logic in `main.py` checks the message content.

3. If the message is a greeting or a command like `help`, it responds accordingly.

4. If the message starts with `verify` or is a long, forwarded message, the bot:

   * Uses **Google Custom Search** to find relevant information.

   * Feeds the search results to **Gemini AI** to get a concise verdict and explanation.

   * Formats a user-friendly response with links to sources.

5. The bot sends the clean, concise response back to the user.</comment-tag id="5" text="The current numbered list is functional but could be more descriptive and engaging. Rephrasing it into more narrative steps can make the process clearer and more impressive to potential users and contributors.

Example:
1.  **Incoming Message:** The bot receives a message from a user.
2.  **Command Detection:** The bot's logic in `main.py` checks for specific commands (`verify`, `help`, etc.) or detects if it is a forwarded/long message.
3.  **Fact-Checking Process:** For fact-checking, the bot uses **Google Custom Search** to find relevant information.
4.  **AI-Powered Verdict:** The search results are then fed to **Gemini AI**, which processes the information to create a concise verdict and a clear explanation.
5.  **Instant Response:** The bot formats a user-friendly response with sources and sends it back to the user on WhatsApp." type="suggestion">

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **MisinfoX** provides automated guidance; always cross-check critical claims with trusted sources.

* The bot requires an active internet connection to function.

* While designed for WhatsApp, the core logic can be adapted for other messaging platforms.
